## Findings

- The popularity of Squid Game : With only one season, Squid Game had the most amount of watch hours globally during the time period analysed. What's more impressive is that it's beaten shows like Money Heist(5 seasons) and You(3 seasons) by watch time!

- English Content vs Non-English content : Apart from Squid Game, there are no shows that are trending worldwide (present in top 10 lists across all the 94 countries) which are English in origin. This shows that regional content or non-English shows are yet to be globally popular.
